it was happy
it had fun
it was glad
it grinned
it got overwhelmed by emotion
its feelings were indescribable
it felt good
it got teary eyed
it got lighthearted
it got nervous
it felt comfortable
it was restless
it got a bit carried away
it felt sorry
it got emotional
it felt nostalgic
it had some difficulty
it felt exhausted
it couldn’t be true to its feelings
it felt proud
they ended up in a foul mood
it got angry
it got jealous
it got sleepy
